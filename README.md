## 📄 Notes

This is a **UI-focused branding website** built as part of my internship project series under the **RISE Internship Program** by Tamizhan Skills.  
It highlights front-end design skills, layout styling, and aesthetic consistency.  
> ❗ This website does not include real e-commerce or dynamic features — it is a **static design project** for visual branding only.
> Note: This demo version currently includes 3 sample products for layout and design demonstration. More products can be added easily using the same format.
